# Python Codes: Machine Learning and Computer Vision

Codes in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision

<b> Welcome to my GitHub repo. </b>

I am a Data Scientist and I code in Python. Here you will find some Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision models I developed.

<b> Outputs of the models can be seen at my portfolio: </b> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0RLknmL54khdjRQWVBKeTVxSHM/view?usp=sharing

Data for models available at:

Keras version used in models: keras==2.0.8
Tensorflow version used in models: keras==1.3.0

<b> COCO Model </b>

This folder presents my Pull Request regarding pycocotools library incompatibility between Python 2 and 3. 

<b> CycleGAN Project </b> -  GANs <br/>

In this folder I presente the steps to train a CycleGAN for Style Transfer applied to paintings of Vincent van Gogh and Pablo Picasso using an EC2 GPU Tesla K-80. Examples of outputs are presented.

<b> DEEP LEARNING SUMMER SCHOOL </b> -  GANs <br/>

In this folder you will find Tensorflow and Keras codes and also a Powerpoint presentation about GANs I developed for my lecture and workshop at the first Deep Learning Summer School in Brazil, at Goiás.
